-- Seed data for development/testing
-- This file is run when using `supabase db seed`

-- Note: We don't insert actual todos here since they're user-specific
-- Instead, we'll create some sample data that can be used for testing

-- You can add sample data here if needed
-- For example, if you had a categories table:
-- INSERT INTO public.categories (name, description) VALUES
-- ('Work', 'Work-related tasks'),
-- ('Personal', 'Personal tasks'),
-- ('Shopping', 'Shopping list items');

-- The todos will be created by users through the application
